# Welcome to your Obsidian Vault

This vault is connected to Claude Code via filesystem MCP.

## Folder Structure

- **Inbox/** - Quick capture, unsorted notes
- **Daily Notes/** - Daily journal entries
- **Projects/** - Project-specific notes
- **Templates/** - Note templates
- **Claude Notes/** - Notes created by Claude Code sessions

## How it works

Claude Code can read, create, and edit notes in this vault directly.
Ask Claude to "create a note about X" and it will appear here.
