# Session: Obsidian Integration Setup

## What was done
- Created Obsidian vault at `C:\Users\tl\Desktop\ObsidianVault`
- Configured filesystem MCP to include vault path
- Set up folder structure: Inbox, Daily Notes, Projects, Templates, Claude Notes
- Created note templates (Daily, Project, Claude Session)
- Researched Obsidian CLI (v1.12, Early Access only, $25 Catalyst)
- Built proactive memory protocol in `~/.claude/rules/memory-protocol.md`

## Decisions
- Vault on Windows side (better for Obsidian GUI)
- Skip Obsidian CLI for now, wait for free public release (est. 3-6 weeks)
- Claude should proactively learn and record, not wait for explicit instructions

## Observed about James
- Wants Claude to behave like a real human assistant with continuity
- Prefers autonomous, proactive behavior over reactive
- Asks clarifying questions before diving in
- Values thorough research when specifically requested

## Next steps
- Use the vault in daily workflow
- Memory will auto-enrich over future sessions
- Upgrade to Obsidian CLI when 1.12 goes public
